# car service booking

This is my repository for the the car-service-booking assingment.

- All my research and all the articles I referred are documented in [research.md](research.md)

- All the steps I have followed/commands I have run and progress is documented in [steps.md](steps.md)

- I have used following tech stacks to implementing this project:
    - PostgreSQL
    - Node js
    - Express js
    - 

## setup
- First, create a `.env` using [template.env](template.env) as a reference.

- DO NOT Change any value for now, just use them as is.

- To start running the data-pipeline and the server, simply run: `npm start`

- This will take some time to run when running for the first time so wait for a while.

- Once the server starts you can test the REST apis from the postman file.
