# car service booking

This is my repository for the car service booking.

- All my research and all the articles I referred to are documented in [research. md](research. md)

- All the steps I have followed/commands I have run and progress is documented in [steps. md](steps. md)

- I have used the following tech stacks to implement this project:
    - PostgreSQL
    - Node js
    - Express js

## setup
- First, create a `.env` using [template. env](template. env) as a reference.

- DO NOT Change any value for now, just use them as is.

- To start running the data pipeline and the server, simply run: `npm start`

- This will take some time to run when running for the first time so wait for a while.

- Once the server starts you can test the REST APIs from the Postman file.
